# README-Generator

## Description

I decided to create a README generator that generates readme's. I decided to do this because it saves time from having to write your own readme's manually everytime. I wasn't able to make the fs write the README but the rest of it functions as normal. It was challenging trying to figure out how to do it. I used prompt to pop up the questions and added the license badge and links to the generate markdown. It was the first time I used require and writetofile in a project. It a fun project even though I Wasn't able to get the Readme to be created.
